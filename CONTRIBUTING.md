# Contributing to the project

This document provides guidelines for contributing and explains how to set up Git Large File Storage (LFS) for working with large files in this repository.

## Setting up Git LFS

Git LFS is used in this project to manage large files, such as datasets (.npy) files and CSV files. Here's how to set it up:

1. Install Git LFS

   - For Ubuntu/Debian distributions use `sudo apt-get install git-lfs`
   - For MacOS with homebrew use `brew install git-lfs`
   - For other systems, download the binary from [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

2. Clone the repository (if you haven't already)

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:salgue441/AI-concentracion.git && cd AI-concentracion
   ```

3. Set up Git LFS

   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

4. Pull the LFS files

   ```bash
   git lfs pull
   ```

## Working with Git LFS

- Git LFS automatically handles tracked files when you pull, push, or checkout branches
- To add new file types to be tracked by Git LFS, use

  ```bash
  git lfs track "*.extension"
  ```

- To see which files are being tracked by Git LFS, use

  ```bash
  git lfs ls-files
  ```

## Contributing Code

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from main.
2. Make your chanes and test them thoroughly.
3. Ensure your code follows the project's coding style.
4. Create a pull request with a clear title and description.

## Handling Large Files

- When adding large files (>100 MB), make sure they are tracked by Git LFS.
- Be mindful of the repository size and only add necessary files.

## Reporting Issues

- Use the issue tracker to report any bugs or request new features.
- Provide a detailed description of the issue and how to reproduce it.
